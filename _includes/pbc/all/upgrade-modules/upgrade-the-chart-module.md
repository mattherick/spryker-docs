## Upgrading from version 1.4.0 to 1.5.0

In the version `1.5.0` of the `Chart` module, we have updated `plotly.js` dependency from version `1.54.5` to `2.26.0`.
We need to upgrade to the latest major to get the latest bug fixes and security fixes, as well as performance in runtime and tooling.
You can find more details about the changes on the [Chart module release](https://github.com/spryker/chart/releases) page.


*Estimated migration time: 15 min*

To upgrade to the new version of the module, do the following:

1. Upgrade the `Chart` module to the new version:

```bash
composer update spryker/chart:"^1.5.0" --update-with-dependencies
```

2. `1.5.0` module version requires update `@spryker/oryx-for-zed` dependency to the `3.1`+ version at the project level. 
In the root `package.json` file, update the `@spryker/oryx-for-zed` dependency version to the `3.1.0` or higher:

```json
{
    "@spryker/oryx-for-zed": "^3.1.0"
}
```

3. Run and build the Backoffice frontend:

```bash
docker/sdk up --assets
```

Or

```bash
npm install && npm run zed
```
